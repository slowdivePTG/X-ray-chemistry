### What to calculate

- Chemical Abundances
- Heating & Cooling Rates
- Equilibrium Temperature
- Intensity of Important Lines

### X-ray processes

#### Energy Deposition, Ionization, Heating Rates

- The physical and chemical state of the dense cloud is insensitive to the shape of the X-ray spectrum, but depend mostly on the ***ratio*** of **the local X-ray energy deposition rate per particle $H_X​$** to **the gas density $n​$**
  $$
  H_ {  { X } } = \int _ { E _ { \min } } ^ { E _ { \max } } \sigma _ { \mathrm { pa } } ( E ) F ( E ) \mathrm d E
  $$
  Here we assume that the Auger electrons contributes an energy equal to the photoionization threshold

  - Ionization rate $\zeta_X\sim n H_X$
  - Molecular formation and cooling rate $\sim n^2k$ , $k$ is a rate coefficient

- Total ionization rate is dominated by the secondary ionization rate
  $$
  \zeta_T\approx N_{sec}(x_e)H_X
  $$
  For $x_e\leq 1\%$ , approximately $40\%$ of the energy goes to the ionization, therefore $N_{sec}(x_e)\sim26(30)$ per $\mathrm{keV}$ of primary photoelectron energy for molecular or atomic hydrogen

  Above $x_e\sim1\%$, more energy goes to Coulomb interactions with ambient thermal electrons

- Heating and excitation rates due to the non thermal electrons are functions of both **the ionization fraction** and **the chemical composition**
  $$
  \Gamma_X\approx f_kH_X
  $$
  $f_k$ is the heating efficiency $\sim 30\%$ to $40\%$ under low $x_e$

  - Atomic

    - Low heating efficiency
    - Once the energy of secondary electrons drop below the exception threshold of Ly$\alpha$ ($10.2\ \mathrm{eV}$), all of the remaining secondary electron energy goes into heating, which is the only way of heating for neutral gas (or low $x_e$)
    - For higher $x_e$ , the radiative recombination energy of protons may be lost to the gas

  - Molecular

    - Much higher heating efficiency

    - Much of the ionization energy may go into heating the gas

    - The $\ce{H2+}$ ion will soon react to produce $\ce{H3+}$
      $$
      \ce{H2+ + H2 -> H3+ + H}, \text{ release energy of } 11 \text{ eV}
      $$
      The $\ce{H3+}$ ion may dissociatively recombine with an electron, so much of the ionization energy goes into the kinetic energy of the products

      For the $11\ \mathrm{eV}$ released, $2\ \mathrm{eV}$ goes to the ionization, $8\ \mathrm{eV}$ goes to heating

    - Significant amount of the primary nonthermal photoelectron energy can go into ***excitation*** of **the rotation-vibration bands of $\ce{H2}$** & **dissociative electrons**
