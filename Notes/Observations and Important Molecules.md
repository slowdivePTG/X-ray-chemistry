# Observations and Important Molecules

## Molecular gas chemistry in AGN I. The IRAM 30 m survey of NGC 1068

> Usero+2004

### Introduction

- Multi-wavelength observational evidence suggests the general properties of neutral interstellar matter in AGN differ from those of quiescent star-forming disks
- UV flux can be attenuated easily, while hard X-ray photons (2-10 keV) can penetrate neutral gas sufficiently - X-ray dominated regions
- HCN/CO emission in NGC 1068

### Important species

- Si/SiO (evaporation of dust by X-ray/grain process by shocks (not X-ray)) (Martín-Pintado et al. 2000)
- HCO+ (and its metastable isomer HOC+) - ratio can be low as 50-100
- CN/HCN (>1 in XDR)
- High CS/CO ratio



## CN and HCN in Dense Interstellar Clouds

>Gai I. Boger & Amiel Sternberg 2005

- The CN/HCN intensityratios are largest near the stellar sources of the illuminating far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields, and the intensity and density ratios decrease with increasing optical depth and distance from the stars



## Molecular line emission in NGC 1068 imaged with ALMA II. The chemistry of the dense molecular gas

> Viti+2014

- The gas in the CND is very dense ($>10^5 \text{ cm}^{−3}$) and hot (*T* > 150 K)
- The AGN position has the lowest CO/HCO+, CO/HCN, and CO/CS column density ratios
