# Background

- Active SMBH - hard X-ray

  - Galactic disk is relatively transparent for hard X-ray photons
  - Get inside the cores of cold dense molecular clouds

- Significance

  - Find possible chemical impacts at different distances from the Galactic center
  - Determine Galactic Habitable Zone

- Methods

  - KROME - solve equilibrium equations ( ODEs ) and calculate chemical evolutions
  - X-ray ionization

- Mechanism

  - Primary Ionization

    - X-ray photon comes across atoms - absorption + release fast electrons with high energy

    - The ionization rate ( for certain energy $E$ ) is proportional to the flux as well as the photon-ionization cross section

  - Secondary Ionization

    - The fast electrons released come across other atoms to cause much more ionizations

    - A H/He mixture model is utilized

    - For other species, as an approximation, consider the ionization rate of Hydrogen times there electron-ionization cross section ratios
