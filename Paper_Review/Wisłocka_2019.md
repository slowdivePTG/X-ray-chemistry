# Comparative analysis of the influence of Sgr A$^*$ and nearby active galactic nuclei on the mass loss of known exoplanets

Wisłocka, Kovaˇ, 2019, arXiv

## Background

- The SMBH at the center of MW, Sgr A*, has undergone a period of strong activity during
  - Initial accretion phase (8 Gyr)
  - More recent episodes (6 Myr, a century)
- Impacts on exoplanets with volatile-rich atmospheres
  - Erosion (EUV, XUV)
  - A possible factor of transitions from gaseous to rocky planets
  - Habitability
- Efficiency of XUV radiation from SMBHs

## Objectives

- Two unexplored questions in the context of the erosive effect of the XUV radiation from SMBHs on planetary atmospheres
  - The effect of Sgr A* in its active and quiescent phases on known exoplanets in the MW
    - Never examed on existing exoplanet data
    - EPE, 54 exoplanets
    - (H/O) atmospheres (e.g. water) 
  - An estimate of the cumulative feedback of XUV radiation of all AGNs up to $z = 0.5$
    - $\sim 10-20\%$ of all energy radiated over the lifetime of the Universe comes from AGNs, thus we should consider the potential cumulative effect of **nearby** AGNs on exoplanets
    - Excluding additional effects from the host stars (e.g. sub-Neptune planets at galactocentric distance of 10 pc - the XUV flux from a solar-like host star is typically much lower than that from an SMBH)
    - All exoplanets are within 8 kpc from the Galactic center - XUV flux significant enough even at 10 kpc
  - Do not consider primary atmospheres of planets

## Data

### Exoplanet samples

- Known Earth-like planets
  - Further study including terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres study and bio-markers searching
  - Habitability 
  - 2 groups
    - Young, ages of host stars < 8 Gyr, quiet Sgr A*
    - Old, > 8 Gyr, exist during the presumed activity period of Sgr A*
- SWEEPS planets, hot Jupiters
  - within 0.76 kpc to Sgr A*, $P$ < 10​ days
  - Ages $\sim$ 10 Gyr, active & quiet period of Sgr A*
- Two features of the Galactic environment
  - Most of the MW extinction curves are taken from neighborhood - local propoerties of dust around the sun
  - There are some different dust species that fit the MW extinction curves - different extinction characteristics
- Neglect the effect of enchanting ISM during the galactic orbital motion
- Parameters required
  - To determine planetary atmospheric mass loss
    - The distance to the irradiation source
    - Mass & Radius
  - To determine H/O loss
    - Parent star radius & temperature: luminosity
    - The semi-major axis of the planet: stellar XUV flux

### AGN samples

- Expect only the closest AGNs to have an effect on the MW planets - z < 0.5
- Used Earth’s position in the MW as a base point to calculate the distances of the EPs to every AGN

## Methods

### Atmospheric mass-loss

- The energy-limited hydrodynamic escape mechanism (analytical)

$$
M _ { \mathrm { lost } } = \frac { \epsilon F _ { \mathrm { XUV } } \pi R _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } } { G M _ { \mathrm { p } } / R _ { \mathrm { p } } } t _ { 0 } \propto \frac { \epsilon } { \rho _ { \mathrm { p } } } \frac { L _ { \mathrm { XUV } } } { D _ { \mathrm { L } } ^ { 2 } } t _ { 0 }
$$

- Energy-limited - $0.1 \leqslant F _ { X U V } \leqslant 10 ^ { 3 - 4 } \operatorname { erg } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { cm } ^ { - 2 }$
- $L _ { \mathrm { XUV } } = \eta _ { \mathrm { X } } L _ { \mathrm { bol } }​$, where $\eta_X\approx0.7​$ is the high-energy photon fraction
- $L _ { \mathrm { XUV } }$ estimation
  - Salpeter time $\Delta t_S= M _ { \mathrm { BH } } / \dot { M } _ { \mathrm { BH } } \approx 50 \mathrm { Myr }$, the mass-independent time it takes  to double the mass of a black hole in the Eddington accretion phase, $t_0=\Delta t_S$
  - $L _ { \mathrm { Edd } } \approx 1.3 \times 10 ^ { 38 } \left( M _ { \mathrm { BH } } / M _ { \odot } \right) \text { erg } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$, $L _ { \mathrm { Sgr } \mathrm { A } ^ { * } } \simeq 10 ^ { - 8.5 } L _ { \mathrm { Edd } }$
  - $\dot { M } _ { B H } = \left( 1 - \epsilon _ { \mathrm { BH } } \right) \dot { M } _ { \mathrm { acc } }$, mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{  acc}}$ and radiative efficiency $ε_{\mathrm{BH}}\approx0.1$
- No photon loss throughout

#### Efficiency parameter $\epsilon$

- Changes with mass, radius, XUV flux, planetary evolution
- Heating and Cooling processes

#### H/O atmospheres

- H/O=2/1 (water)
- Include stellar XUV flux, assuming that all stars lie on the main sequence (MS) and have $η_X = 10^{−3}$
- Mass loss is due to Sgr A* alone, for the stellar flux is used solely to estimate the wind temperature

### Full-sky AGN sample

- SDSS observations cover only $\sim$ 15 h of the sky
- Generated a model of the AGN distribution covering the full sky, with an assumed isotropic distribution around the MW
- 99.7% of the total flux comes from *z* < 0.0015, though only a small fraction of AGNs are within this redshift

## Results

- SWEEPS planets (only 2 confirmed) (Fig. 5)
  - $M-P$ anticorrelation - blue points
  - Period-mass-radius $(P-M-R)​$ relation - ultra-short period - red points
  - confirmed ones - yellow points
  - Density mainly determines the mass loss
  - May be up to 4 times the earth's atmosphere, no more than $10^{-7}\%​$
- Sgr A* and Earth-like planets 
  - H-only atmospheres (Fig. 6&7)
    - Young, no more than $10^{-13}\%$ of the bulk mass, may be $10^{-8}\%$ of the mass of the atmosphere
    - Old, $10^{-7}\%$ of the bulk mass
  - H/O atmospheres (Fig. 8)
    - O is not dragged along with H flux
    - Same as H-only case
- Neighbor AGNs and the Milky Way Earth-like planets
  - Earth, $\sim 10^{-6}\%$ of bulk mass, $\sim 1\%$ of the atmosphere
  - Density determines

## Discussion

- Sgr A* 
  - For EPs, only those migrated within the Galaxy may experience atmospheric erosion
  - H/O atmosphere, after water molecules have been dissociated, H escapes leaving O behind - water loss - did not account for dissociation energy
- AGN effects
  - Not yet acknowledged
  - Large error, upon adding $\sim$ 500 AGNs with z < 0.0015, the total FUV flux increases significantly
  - $\tau=0$,  most of the AGNs show broad lines in their spectra, implying a more face-on inclination and therefore $τ ≪ 1$
- Effects of galaxy mergers
  - may affect the formation of SMBH and trigger AGN activity
