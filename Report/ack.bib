	abstract = {Chemistry plays a key role in many astrophysical situations regulating the cooling and the thermal properties of the gas, which are relevant during gravitational collapse, the evolution of disks and the fragmentation process. In order to simplify the usage of chemical networks in large numerical simulations, we present the chemistry package KROME, consisting of a Python pre-processor which generates a subroutine for the solution of chemical networks which can be embedded in any numerical code. For the solution of the rate equations, we make use of the high-order solver DLSODES, which was shown to be both accurate and efficient for sparse networks, which are typical in astrophysical applications. KROME also provides a large set of physical processes connected to chemistry, including photochemistry, cooling, heating, dust treatment, and reverse kinetics. The package presented here already contains a network for primordial chemistry, a small metal network appropriate for the modelling of low metallicities environments, a detailed network for the modelling of molecular clouds, a network for planetary atmospheres, as well as a framework for the modelling of the dust grain population. In this paper, we present an extended test suite ranging from one-zone and 1D-models to first applications including cosmological simulations with ENZO and RAMSES and 3D collapse simulations with the FLASH code. The package presented here is publicly available at http://kromepackage.org/ and https://bitbucket.org/krome/krome{\_}stable},

We find that about 50 per cent of all planets in the Universe may lose a mass of hydrogen of ∼2.5 × 1019 g (the total mass of the Martian atmosphere), 10 per cent may lose ∼5.1 × 1021 g (the total mass of Earth’s atmosphere), and 0.2 per cent may lose ∼1.4 × 1024g (the total mass of Earth’s oceans).

abstract = {Context. The detailed evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres has been the subject of decade-long studies. Only recently, investigations began on the possible atmospheric mass loss caused by the activity of galactic central engines. This question has so far been explored without using available exoplanet data. Aims. The goal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the erosion of exoplanetary atmospheres through radiation from super-massive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase. Methods. To this end, we extended the well-known energy-limited mass-loss model to include the case of radiation from AGNs. We set the fraction of incident power available to heat the atmosphere as either constant (= 0.1) or flux dependent (= (F XUV)). We calculated the possible atmospheric mass loss for 54 known exoplanets (of which 16 are hot Jupiters residing in the Galactic bulge and 38 are Earth-like planets (EPs)) due to radiation from the Milky Way's (MW) central SMBH, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and from a set of 107,220 AGNs generated using the 33,350 AGNs at z {\textless} 0.5 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. Results. We found that planets in the Galactic bulge might have lost up to several Earth atmospheres in mass during the AGN phase of Sgr A*, while the EPs are at a safe distance from Sgr A* ({\textgreater} 7 kpc) and have not undergone any atmospheric erosion in their lifetimes. We also found that the MW EPs might experience a mass loss up to ∼ 15 times the Mars atmosphere over a period of 50 Myr as the result of exposure to the cumulative extreme-UV flux F XUV from the AGNs up to z = 0.5. In both cases we found that an incorrect choice of can lead to significant mass loss overestimates.},

	abstract = {We discuss mm-wavelength radio, 2.2-11.8um NIR and 2-10 keV X-ray light curves of the super massive black hole (SMBH) counterpart of Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) near its lowest and highest observed luminosity states. The luminosity during the low state can be interpreted as synchrotron emission from a continuous or even spotted accretion disk. For the high luminosity state SSC emission from THz peaked source components can fully account for the flux density variations observed in the NIR and X-ray domain. We conclude that at near-infrared wavelengths the SSC mechanism is responsible for all emission from the lowest to the brightest flare from SgrA*. For the bright flare event of 4 April 2007 that was covered from the radio to the X-ray domain, the SSC model combined with adiabatic expansion can explain the related peak luminosities and different widths of the flare profiles obtained in the NIR and X-ray regime as well as the non detection in the radio domain.},

	abstract = {Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) lying in the Galactic Centre {\$}8{\$} kpc from Earth, hosts the closest supermassive black hole known to us. It is now inactive, but there is evidence indicating that about six million years ago it underwent a powerful outburst where the luminosity could have approached the Eddington limit. Motivated by the fact that in extragalaxies the supermassive black holes with similar masses and near-Eddington luminosities are usually strong X-ray emitters, we calculate here the X-ray luminosity of SgrA*. For that, we assume that the outburst was due to accretion of gas or the tidal disruption of a star. We show that these cases could precipitate on Earth a hard X-ray (i.e. {\$}h\backslashnu{\textgreater}2{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm keV{\}}{\$}) flux comparable to that from the current quiescent sun. The flux in harder energy band {\$}20{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm keV{\}}{\textless}h\backslashnu{\textless}100{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm keV{\}}{\$}, however, surpasses that from an X-class solar flare, and the irradiation timescale is also much longer, ranging from weeks to {\$}10{\^{}}5{\$} years depending on the outburst scenario. In the solar system gas giants will suffer the biggest impact in their atmospheres. Lower-mass planets such as Earth receive a level of radiation that might have played a role in the evolution of their primitive atmospheres, so that a detailed study of the consequences deserves further investigation. Planetary systems closer to SgrA* receive higher irradiance levels, making them more likely inhabitable.},

	abstract = {Detailed models for the density and temperature profiles of gas and dust in protoplanetary disks are constructed by taking into account X-ray and UV irradiation from a central T Tauri star, as well as dust size growth and settling toward the disk midplane. The spatial and size distributions of dust grains are numerically computed by solving the coagulation equation for settling dust particles, with the result that the mass and total surface area of dust grains per unit volume of the gas in the disks are very small, except at the midplane. The H2 level populations and line emission are calculated using the derived physical structure of the disks. X-ray irradiation is the dominant heating source of the gas in the inner disk and in the surface layer, while the UV heating dominates otherwise. If the central star has strong X-ray and weak UV radiation, the H2 level populations are controlled by X-ray pumping, and the X-ray-induced transition lines could be observable. If the UV irradiation is strong, the level populations are controlled by thermal collisions or UV pumping, depending on the dust properties. As the dust particles evolve in the disks, the gas temperature at the disk surface drops because the grain photoelectric heating becomes less efficient. This makes the level populations change from LTE to non-LTE distributions, which results in changes to the line ratios. Our results suggest that dust evolution in protoplanetary disks could be observable through the H2 line ratios. The emission lines are strong from disks irradiated by strong UV and X-rays and possessing small dust grains; such disks will be good targets in which to observe H2 emission.},

The resultant fractionation as a function of mass yields a linear or concave downward plot in a graph of logarithm of remaining inventory against atomic mass. An episode of hydrodynamic escape early in the history of Mars could have resulted in the mass-dependent depletion of the noble gases observed in the Martian atmosphere, if Mars was initially hydrogen rich. Similarly, a hydrodynamic escape episode early in Earth's history could have yielded a mass-dependent fractionation of the xenon isotopes. The required hydrodynamic escape fluxes and total amounts of hydrogen lost from the planets in these episodes are large, but not impossibly so. The theory of the mass fractionation process is simple, but more work will be needed to put together an internally consistent scenario that reconciles a range of data from different planets. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

We recalculate the X-ray ionization rate using our explicit elemental composition and X-ray energy spectrum. We find that photochemistry has a larger influence on the molecular composition than X-ray ionization. Observable molecules sensitive to the photorates include OH, HCO+,N2H+,H2O, CO2, and CH3OH. The only molecule significantly affected by the X-ray ionization is N2H+, indicating that it is safe to adopt existing approximations of the X-ray ionization rate in typical T Tauri star–disk systems.Therecalculation of the photorates increases the abundances of neutralmolecules in the outer disk, highlighting the importance of taking into account the shape of the UV spectrum in protoplanetary disks. A recalculation of the photoreaction rates also affects the gas-phase chemistry due to the adjustment of the H/H2 and C+/C ratios. The disk ionization fraction is not significantly affected by themethods adopted to calculate the photochemistry and X-ray ionization. We determine that there is a probable “dead zone” where accretion is suppressed, present in a layer, Z/R ? 0.1–0.2, in the disk midplane, within R ≈ 200 AU.},

	abstract = {Context. The detailed evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres has been the subject of decade-long studies. Only recently, investigations began on the possible atmospheric mass loss caused by the activity of galactic central engines. This question has so far been explored without using available exoplanet data. Aims. The goal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the erosion of exoplanetary atmospheres through radiation from super-massive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase. Methods. To this end, we extended the well-known energy-limited mass-loss model to include the case of radiation from AGNs. We set the fraction of incident power available to heat the atmosphere as either constant (= 0.1) or flux dependent (= (F XUV)). We calculated the possible atmospheric mass loss for 54 known exoplanets (of which 16 are hot Jupiters residing in the Galactic bulge and 38 are Earth-like planets (EPs)) due to radiation from the Milky Way's (MW) central SMBH, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and from a set of 107,220 AGNs generated using the 33,350 AGNs at z {\textless} 0.5 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. Results. We found that planets in the Galactic bulge might have lost up to several Earth atmospheres in mass during the AGN phase of Sgr A*, while the EPs are at a safe distance from Sgr A* ({\textgreater} 7 kpc) and have not undergone any atmospheric erosion in their lifetimes. We also found that the MW EPs might experience a mass loss up to ∼ 15 times the Mars atmosphere over a period of 50 Myr as the result of exposure to the cumulative extreme-UV flux F XUV from the AGNs up to z = 0.5. In both cases we found that an incorrect choice of can lead to significant mass loss overestimates.},

Although stellar winds may absorb soft X-rays, hard X-rays can penetrate to large column densities and, until they are absorbed, produce ionization rates greater than standard estimates for Galactic cosmic rays. As in previous studies of the external ionization of protopla-netary disks by cosmic rays, we Ðnd that X-ray ionization produces a surface layer that is well coupled to disk magnetic Ðelds at DAU distances. The properties of the surface layer depend on the character-istics of the X-ray source and, thus, on the evolutionary status of the central star. Even if Galactic cosmic rays are efficiently excluded by magnetized winds, stellar X-ray irradiation alone may provide sufficient ionization for disks to accrete via the Balbus-Hawley instability. The resulting vertically layered structure of disks at DAU distances (a well-coupled surface layer overlying a poorly coupled, deeper layer) may lead to divergent dynamical evolution in the two regions. While accretion in the surface layer contributes to the buildup of the mass of the star, the quiescent conditions in the poorly coupled, deeper layer appear to be conducive to the formation of planets.},

	abstract = {We have modeled the physical and chemical state of dense (n = 103-105 cm-3) neutral gas exposed to intense X-ray fluxes and the resultant infrared and submillimeter emission from the irradiated gas. The dominant parameter controlling the state of the gas in these X-ray dissociation regions (XDRs) is the ratio of local X-ray energy deposition rate to gas density; this can be expressed in terms of an effective ionization parameter. The parameter space we model ranges over 5 orders of magnitude in this ionization parameter; the gas physical conditions vary from warm, atomic, and partially ionized (T ∼ 104 K, molecular hydrogen abundance XH2 ≤ 10-4, electron abundance Xe 0.1) to cold, molecular, and neutral (T ∼20 K, XH2 ≍ 0.5, Xe ∼10-6). We thus cover the entire range of parameter space in which X-ray ionization and heating is important and the gas is largely neutral. Although we assume a power law for the incident X-ray flux, most of our results are independent of this assumption and are of general applicability. A wide range of diagnostic atomic and molecular line emission is produced by XDRs, which are luminous sources of infrared and submillimeter lines. This is a consequence of the large column densities (N {\textgreater} 1022 cm-2) that hard (E {\textgreater} 1 keV) photons are capable of penetrating before being absorbed. Strong emission lines include [Fe n] 1.26 and 1.64 $\mu$m, [O I] 63 $\mu$m, [C II] 158 $\mu$m, [Si II] 35 $\mu$m, and the 2 $\mu$m vibration-rotation lines of H2, such as the V = 1-0 5(1) line at 2.12 $\mu$m. We discuss diagnostic line ratios for discriminating XDRs from shocks and photodissociation regions. One strong signature of emission from XDRs is the large flux ratio (∼0.1) of the major coolant line fluxes (e.g., [O I] 63 $\mu$m) to the bolometric continuum flux. XDRs are likely to be the dominant sources of emission in a range of astrophysical environments, such as molecular clouds within roughly 1 kpc of typical active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {We present chemical models of the envelope of a young stellar object (YSO) exposed to a central X-ray source. The models are applied to the massive star-forming region AFGL 2591 for different X-ray fluxes. The total X-ray ionization rate is dominated by the `secondary' ionization rate of H2 resulting from fast electrons. The carbon, sulphur and nitrogen chemistries are discussed. It is found that He+ and H3+ are enhanced and trigger a peculiar chemistry. Several molecular X-ray tracers are found and compared to tracers of the far ultraviolet (FUV) field. Like ultraviolet radiation fields, X-rays enhance simple hydrides, ions and radicals. In contrast to ultraviolet photons, X-rays can penetrate deep into the envelope and affect the chemistry even at large distances from the source. Whereas the FUV enhanced species cover a region of 200-300 AU, the region enhanced by X-rays is {\textgreater}1000 AU. Best-fit models for AFGL 2591 predict an X-ray luminosity LX {\textgreater} 1e+31 ergs/s with a hard X-ray spectrum TX {\textgreater} 3e+07 K. Furthermore, we find LX/Lbol {\~{}} 1e-6. The chemistry of the bulk of the envelope mass is dominated by cosmic-ray induced reactions rather than by X-ray induced ionization for X-ray luminosities LX {\textless} 1e+33 ergs/s. The calculated line intensities of HCO+ and HCS+ show that high-J lines are more affected than lower J lines by the presence of X-rays due to their higher critical densities, and that such differences are detectable even with large aperture single-dish telescopes. Future instruments such as Herschel-HIFI or SOFIA will be able to observe X-ray enhanced hydrides whereas the sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA is well-suited to measure the size and geometry of the region affected by X-rays.},

Highly charged ions are rapidly reduced to the doubly charged state in neutral gas, so the aim here is to derive the production rates for these singly and doubly charged ions and to specify their transformation by recombination, charge transfer, and molecular reactions. The theory is illustrated by calculations of the abundances of 11 of the most cosmically abundant heavy elements in a model of a typical T Tauri star disk. The physical properties of the gas are determined with an X-ray irradiated thermal-chemical model, which shows that the disk atmosphere consists of a hot atmosphere overlaying the mainly cool body of the disk. There is a warm transition layer where hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen are transformed from atomic to molecular species and the ionization drops by several orders of magnitude. The doubly charged ions are then largely confined to the hot outer layers of the disk. The nature of the dominant ions below the transition depends sensitively on the poorly constrained abundances of the heavy elements. Observational consequences and connections with the active layers of the magnetorotational instability are briefly discussed.},

Our findings show that the value of J{\_}{\{}21{\}}{\^{}}crit is a few times 104 and only weakly depends on the adopted radiation spectra in the range between Trad = 2 × 104and105 K. For three simulated haloes of a few times 107 M⊙, J{\_}{\{}21{\}}{\^{}}crit varies from 2 × 104 to 5 × 104.

Here we test this hypothesis by limiting ourselves to the case of diffuse clouds and assuming that the average cosmic ray spectrum inside the Galaxy is equal to the one at the position of the Sun as measured by Voyager 1 and AMS-02. To calculate the cosmic ray spectrum inside the clouds, we solve the one-dimensional transport equation taking into account advection, diffusion and energy losses. While outside the cloud particles diffuse, in its interior they are assumed to gyrate along magnetic field lines because ion-neutral friction is effective in damping all the magnetic turbulence. We show that ionization losses effectively reduce the CR flux in the cloud interior for energies below {\$}\backslashapprox 100{\$} MeV, especially for electrons, in such a way that the ionization rate decreases by roughly 2 order of magnitude with respect to the case where losses are neglected. As a consequence, the predicted ionization rate is more than 10 times smaller than the one inferred from the detection of molecular lines. We discuss the implication of our finding in terms of spatial fluctuation of the Galactic cosmic ray spectra and possible additional sources of low energy cosmic rays.},

	abstract = {Virtually all detailed gas-phase models of the chemistry of dense interstellar clouds exclude polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This omission is unfortunate because from the few studies that have been done on the subject, it is known that the inclusion of PAHs can affect the gas-phase chemistry strongly. We have added PAHs to our network to determine the role they play in the chemistry of cold dense cores. Initially, only the chemistry of neutral and negatively charged PAH species was considered, since it was assumed that positively charged PAHs are of little importance. Subsequently, this assumption was checked and confirmed. In the models presented here, we include radiative attachment to form PAH-, mutual neutralization between PAH anions and small positively charged ions, and photodetachment. We also test the sensitivity of our results to changes in the size and abundance of the PAHs. Our results confirm that the inclusion of PAHs changes many of the calculated abundances of smaller species considerably. In TMC-1, the general agreement with observations is significantly improved, unlike in L134N. This may indicate a difference in PAH properties between the two regions. With the inclusion of PAHs in dense cloud chemistry, high-metal elemental abundances give a satisfactory agreement with observations. As a result, we do not need to decrease the observed elemental abundances of all metals, and we do not need to vary the elemental C/O ratio in order to produce large abundances of carbon species in TMC-1 (CP).},

	abstract = {Aims. With the Green Bank telescope (GBT), seven neutral molecules have been newly detected or confirmed towards either the cold interstellar core TMC-1 or the hot core source Sgr B2(N) within the last 1–2 years. Towards TMC-1, the new molecules seen are cyanoallene (CH 2 CCHCN) and methyl triacetylene (CH 3 C 6 H) while methyl cyanoacetylene (CH 3 CCCN) and methyl cyanodiacety-lene (CH 3 C 5 N) were confirmed. Towards Sgr B2(N), the three newly detected molecules are cyclopropenone (c-C 3 H 2 O), ketenimine (CH 2 CNH), and acetamide (CH 3 CONH 2); these are mainly seen in absorption and are primarily located in an envelope around the hot core. In this work, we report a detailed study of the gas-phase chemistry of all seven molecules. Methods. Starting with our updated gas-phase chemical reaction network osu.01.2007, we added formation and depletion reactions to treat the chemistry of each of the seven molecules. Some of these were already in our network but with incomplete chemistry, while most were not in the network at all prior to this work. We assumed the standard physical conditions for TMC-1 and assumed that these also hold for the envelope around Sgr B2(N). Standard pseudo-time-dependent calculations were run for each source. Results. For TMC-1, we reproduced the observed fractional abundances of three detected molecules at early times of 10 5−6 yr and came close to reproducing a fourth. For the halo surrounding Sgr B2(N), our results are more ambiguous: only for ketenimine were we able to match the observed abundance very well.},

@article{Wakelam2010,
	abstract = {We survey the current situation regarding chemical modelling of the synthesis of molecules in the interstellar medium. The present state of knowledge concerning the rate coefficients and their uncertainties for the major gas-phase processes—ion-neutral reactions, neutral-neutral reactions, radiative association, and dissociative recombination—is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on those key reactions that have been identified, by sensitivity analyses, as ‘crucial' in determining the predicted abundances of the species observed in the interstellar medium. These sensitivity analyses have been carried out for gas-phase models of three representative, molecule-rich, astronomical sources: the cold dense molecular clouds TMC-1 and L134N, and the expanding circumstellar envelope IRC +10216. Our review has led to the proposal of new values and uncertainties for the rate coefficients of many of the key reactions. The impact of these new data on the predicted abundances in TMC-1 and L134N is reported. Interstellar dust particles also influence the observed abundances of molecules in the interstellar medium. Their role is included in gas-grain, as distinct from gas-phase only, models. We review the methods for incorporating both accretion onto, and reactions on, the surfaces of grains in such models, as well as describing some recent experimental efforts to simulate and examine relevant processes in the laboratory. These efforts include experiments on the surface-catalyzed recombination of hydrogen atoms, on chemical processing on and in the ices that are known to exist on the surface of interstellar grains, and on desorption processes, which may enable species formed on grains to return to the gas-phase.},

	abstract = {We report on the presence of large amounts of million-degree gas in the Milky Way's interstellar and circum-galactic medium. This gas (1) permeates both the Galactic plane and the halo, (2) extends to distances larger than 60-200 kpc from the center, and (3) its mass is sufficient to close the Galaxy's baryon census. Moreover, we show that a vast, {\$}\backslashsim 6{\$} kpc radius, spherically-symmetric central region of the Milky Way above and below the 0.16 kpc thick plane, has either been emptied of hot gas or the density of this gas within the cavity has a peculiar profile, increasing from the center up to a radius of {\$}\backslashsim 6{\$} kpc, and then decreasing with a typical halo density profile. This, and several other converging pieces of evidence, suggest that the current surface of the cavity, at 6 kpc from the Galaxy's center, traces the distant echo of a period of strong nuclear activity of our super-massive black-hole, occurred about 6 Myrs ago.},
