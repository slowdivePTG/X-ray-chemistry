**Chemical impacts of X-ray from an active supermassive black hole in our galaxy**

## Introduction

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are widely held in galaxies. Sgr A* is believed as the SMBH in our galaxy with a mass of $(3.6\pm0.3)\times10^{6}M_\odot$. It is on an ongoing quiescent state with suprisingly low luminosity $L\sim10^{33-35}\text{erg s}^{-1}$, no more than $10^{-9}L_\text{Edd}$, where $L_{\mathrm{Edd}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{38}\left(M_{\mathrm{BH}} / M_{\odot}\right) \operatorname{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\sim 5\times10^{44} \operatorname{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is the Eddington luminosity. Researches on the physical and chemical influence of the electromagnetic radiation of Sgr A* on planetary atmospheres and

Observations have shown evidence that the SMBH went through an active phase several million years ago.
